Decay Model For Rewards - Designed by Sartaj
=============================

Adding a decay model for deferred rewards, including ownership, royalties, and profit sharing.

* **Vision**
    * 1. Reward contributors of a contribution.
    * 1. Prevent previous contributors who don't currently contribute from stifling growth for current and future contributors.
    * 2. Minimize risk of liabilities and confusion.

* **Decay Model for Rewards**
    * Decay Algorithms Examples
        * Linear Decay
            * Ex: User loses 0.1% per dividend payout.
        * [Exponential Decay]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay")
        * Contribution Usage Based Decay (For example, logo usage, software code usage, etc).
            * Ex. A chunk of code is valued at a certain amount. The share % could go down based on:
                * % of code still being used.
                * Value code brings to system.
            * This method could become very confusing
                * - Minimize risk of liabilities and confusion. 
* **Reward Types**
    * Ownership (Stocks)
        * Voting Rights
    * Royalties/Profit Sharing
* **Rate Calculation Methods.** Decision can be a combination of the following.
    * Mathmatical 
    * Community Agreement
    * Task Oriented
        * ex: for software, checking for code usage.  

* **Users**
    * **Proposed** 
        * [HITRECORD](http://www.hitrecord.org/albums/337762/)
  
* **TODO**
    * Talk to lawyers
    * Create simple algorithm based on dividend payout.
    * Develop document generator.
        * Develop Algorithm Generator

**Example**
Bob makes a song thats used in an episode. The leaders (RegularJoe & company) value the song at $3000. Because of financial constraints, the leaders pay Bob $500, and based on the $2500 owed, decide to give Bob 1% of a future dividend payout. Sometime in the future HITRECORD makes some better money and Joe decided to payout a dividend that'll reward the hard work of artists and still let HITRECORD grow. Let's say that dividend pool is $50,000. For that dividend, Bob would get 1%, or $500. After that for every future dividend payment, Bob's % would decay by 0.1%. So the second payment he'd get 0.9%, then 0.8%, etc till it reaches 0%. In this model, at a $50,000 dividend payout, Bob would make $2750 by the time he reaches 0%. That + the initial $500 means he made $3250, means HITRECORD could pay him more than $3000 over time without crippling the collective. 

• Benefits of this model:
• Better focus on art: Artist have a life too. By providing good compensation, you motivate artists to focus more on building amazing pieces and less on balancing bank accounts. 

• Better art: Better focus on art will trigger better art. If a community rewards its people to help it grow, the people will naturally be more inclined to push their own creative limits, and thus the creative limits of community.

• Avoiding ownership/profit sharing problems: Almost all profit sharing models are based on infinite compensation/ownership models. This creates a problem because founders of a company/group end up crippling future creators reward by always taking a profit, even if they provide no future benefit. The decay model avoids this issue while still rewarding artists for helping the growth.

======

The numbers above are hypothetical and would need to be ironed out, but I do believe that the principles of this model provide a great balance between rewarding creators for community growth without crippling community growth. 

Let me know what you think.
